# opalite

A containerized working environment for the particle tracking code
[OPAL](https://gitlab.psi.ch/OPAL/src) ([version 1.6.2](https://gitlab.psi.ch/OPAL/src/-/tree/OPAL-1.6.2))

In order to get this image to build I had to make a few edits to the project's
CMake; see the commentary in `Dockerfile` for more details.
